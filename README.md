# face_mask_detection_using_python
## Topic: Real Time Video Detection of Mask/No Mask Using Python.
### Description:
This project involves 2 key files.They are-

i>train_mask_detector.py - This python file is used to build a CNN model by making use of Mobile Net.It generates a plot of Training Loss and Accuracy v/s No.of.Epochs along with a file containing the model trained. 

ii>detect_mask_video.py - This python file is used to detect real time video for checking if the person is wearing a mask or not and depicting the same by drawing a rectangle using cv2 and a text field just above it indicating whether the user is wearing a mask or not and the prediction score.

### Libraries Used:
i>tensorflow>=1.15.2

ii>keras==2.3.1

iii>imutils==0.5.3

iv>numpy==1.18.2

v>opencv-python==4.2.0.*

vi>matplotlib==3.2.1
